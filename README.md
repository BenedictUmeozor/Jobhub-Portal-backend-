# Jobhub portal

Welcome to Jobhub! (Backend)

JobHub is a practice project I created with passion and dedication. This application aims to provide a simplified job application platform where users can apply for jobs and employers can post job listings. As a beginner, this project serves as a stepping stone in the exciting world of software development for me, offering opportunities to learn, experiment, and grow.

### What I learned



This is the backend code for JobHub, my first Node.js project. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in creating an Express server and establishing connections to MongoDB using Mongoose. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of MongoDB's database relationships. It has been an excellent starter project that helped me develop my skills and knowledge in web development. I look forward to further enhancing this project and taking on more challenging endeavors in the future.
